## Technical Debt & Improvements

### ✅ ES Module Directory Import Fix (COMPLETED)
**Issue Resolved:** Directory import errors have been fixed using Option B approach.

**Solution Implemented:** Eliminated index files and used direct imports
- **Approach**: Option B - Eliminate Index Files and Use Direct Imports
- **Completed on**: 2024-12-22
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**What was Done:**
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Eliminated index files in core modules and used direct imports
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Eliminated index files in action modules and used direct imports  
- **Phase 3**: ✅ Eliminated index files in IPC modules and used direct imports
- **Phase 4**: ✅ Eliminated index files in shortcut modules and used direct imports
- **Phase 5**: ✅ Eliminated index files in vault modules and used direct imports
- **Phase 6**: ✅ Tested all functionality and verified build works

**Changes Made:**
1. **Removed all index.ts files** from subdirectories in core, actions, ipc, shortcuts, and vault modules
2. **Updated all imports** to use direct file paths instead of directory imports:
   - `from './core'` → `from './core/lifecycle/app-lifecycle'`
   - `from './actions/file'` → `from './actions/file/file-actions'`
   - `from './shortcuts/types'` → `from './shortcuts/types/shortcut-types'`
   - `from './vault/core'` → `from './vault/core/vault-factory'`
   - etc.
3. **Fixed test imports** to match the new direct import structure
4. **Verified functionality** through comprehensive testing

**Results:**
- ✅ Development workflow (`make dev`) now works without errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes successfully
- ✅ All unit tests (129 tests) pass
- ✅ Production build works correctly
- ✅ Electron packaging works successfully
- ✅ No ES module import errors

**Benefits Achieved:**
- More explicit imports showing exactly what's being imported
- Smaller bundle sizes (no unnecessary index.ts re-exports)
- Cleaner architecture with direct dependencies
- Better IDE support for navigating to actual implementation files
- Eliminated all module resolution ambiguity

**Commercial Impact:**
- ✅ Development workflow fully restored
- ✅ Production builds working
- ✅ Ready for commercial development and deployment
